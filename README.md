# Mapping_Earthquakes_Challenge
Using Leaflet.js, D3.js, and GeoJSON.
# Resources
Earthquake GeoJSON data
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

# Execution:

To complete this project, we used a GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. We then add the data to a map, including various different map styles. We also allow the user to toggle the earthquake markers or tectonic plate lines on-and-off.

# Examples:

* When you load the page, it defaults to the Streets view with both the Earthquakes and Tectonic Plate overlays engaged. The legend shows you the color coding for various magnitudes.

* You can select one of three different different map styles, such as the Dark theme shown below:

* You can also toggle the Earthquakes to show or not-show, as well as the Tectonic Plates.
